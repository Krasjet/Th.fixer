Th.fixer
========

Th.fixer is a simple Python script that removes the Th, TT ligatures (and their
friends), which can be found in Linux Libertine, Alegreya, Cormorant, and many
Adobe Originals fonts, from a font's standard ligature set (liga).

Usage
-----

To use this script, you first need to install FontForge [1] and register it as
a Python extension [2].

If you are using Arch Linux, simply install the package fontforge by

  $ pacman -S fontforge

Unfortunately, FontForge is not available on PyPI, so you have to install it
manually.

The script takes a single argument by default---the filename of the font file to
be modified. If you want all the default behaviors, you can run the script by

  $ ./thfixer.py font.otf

The output file will be in `out/font.otf`.

There are some optional arguments for further customizations. You can see all
the options by

  $ ./thfixer.py -h

which will output

  usage: thfixer.py [-h] [-s] [-t] [-d OUTPUT_DIR] [-o OUT_FILENAME] [-f]
                    filename

  Remove the 'Th' ligature (and its friends) from a font's standard ligature set
  ('liga').

  positional arguments:
    filename              name of the input file

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -s, --fix-swash       include this flag if you want to remove the 'Th'
                          ligature for swash 'T' as well
    -t, --fix-tt          include this flag if you want to remove the 'TT'
                          ligature as well
    -d OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                          the modified font will be saved to this directory
                          (default 'out')
    -o OUT_FILENAME, --out-filename OUT_FILENAME
                          name of the output file. the input filename will be
                          used if this option is not supplied
    -f, --use-fontname    include this flag if you want the output filename to
                          be the builtin fontname. if this flag is enabled, out-
                          filename will be ignored

For example, if you want to enable `fix-swash`, `fix-tt`, `use-fontname`
options and set the output directory to `fixed`, then you can run the script by

  $ ./thfixer.py -stf -d fixed font.otf
